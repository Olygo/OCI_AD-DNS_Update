# OCI_AD-DNS_Update

**OCI_AD-DNS_Update** is a [Cloud-Init](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/launchinginstance.htm#:~:text=For%20more%20information%2C%20see%20Getting%20Instance%20Metadata.-,Initialization%20script,-%3A%20User%20data%20to%20be%20used%20by%20cloud) script that updates a Windows Active Directory Domain joined Instance after restoring a clone or a backup.

After a Domain Joined instance is restored, you must update the DNS server addresses associated with the TCP/IP properties on its interface otherwise
the instance may have difficulties to find its Domain Controler which results in a slowdown at the first start.

Updating the restored instance during the provisionning fixes this issue transparently.
